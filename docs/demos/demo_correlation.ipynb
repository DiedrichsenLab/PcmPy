    "How similar/correlated are two activity patterns? It is easy to test whether 2 activity patterns are more correlated than chance (i.e., zero correlation). However, even if the two conditions elicit exactly the same pattern, the correlation will not be 1, simply because of measurement noise. To approach this problem, we can obtain the maximum-likelihood estimator of the correlations, using repeated measurements of the same two activity patttens across multiple runs (repetitions). Note that this estimator is not unbiased, and can get unstable for very low signal to noise datasets - so we need to be caseful in the interpretation and inference.   \n",
